# Rainwater harvesting design

(These notes were reconstituted from many emails around that time)

Model soakaway crate used is 1000 x 1000 x 400 mm deep and requires 500 mm of soil above it.

Top of the lower reed bed tray to be 74.25. Top of the 0.4m deep soakaway to be 74.19, with a 6 cm fall between them. Each reed bed tray is 0.2m fall.

Footpath north of house is 74.60. Channel drain south of footpath 74.50 (slope 1% from house footpath). Footpath east of outhouse is 74.60. Top of first reed bed tray is 74.47 (slope 0.5% from channel drain next to outhouse). Top of second reed bed tray is 74.25 (0.22m drop). Top of underground storage tank is 74.24.

For underground storage to overflow into stormwater mains, top of stormwater drain has to be no higher than 73.99 (1% slope over 15 metres). Footpath is 74.36, and min thickness according to regs is 225 mm. Assuming 250 mm, top of stormwater drain will be no higher than 74.11 and as a 110mm diameter pipe, its bottom would be 74.00.

I can't explain, looking at it now, why I thought a 0.2m fall is needed _per tray_. As far as I can tell now, It is a _once off_ 0.2m fall into the 0.8m deep tray, because the inlet pipe comes in below the top of the tray. The Kingspan trays take a 110 mm inlet pipe, the Herr trays seem to take a 50 mm inlet pipe. After your once off 0.2m drop from the top, the trays can all be equal height as static pressure will ensure each tray gets the same height of water -- indeed, they could be connected by a bottom pipe for water level equalisation, and the outlet water drawn off the top.

That might explain some of the more confusing parts of the above where I did the measurement of the outlet from the top of the second tray. I must have also been thinking in at top, between trays at bottom, out at top.

The Kingspan tray is 2.5m long, 0.8m wide and 0.8m deep. Not sure what the dimensions of the Herr tray is.
