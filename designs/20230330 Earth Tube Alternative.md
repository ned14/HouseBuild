Given that quotes for the Rehau Awadukt Thermo delivered to Ireland are
coming in over €7k ex VAT, what alternatives are there?

# Option 1: Water pipes

The Rehau pipes are just very high quality polypropylene 200 mm mains
water pipes with a specially sprayed inner of silver oxide. One
could just source bog standard 200 mm mains water pipes instead.
https://www.mcmahons.ie/200mm-pvc-watermain-pipe-class-c-x-6m
lists 200 mm 10 bar capable PVC watermains pipes 6m length for
€80.89 ex VAT each. This seems suspiciously cheap? They also have a
250mm diameter edition. These probably refer to outside diameter,
not DN diameter which is the inside.

225 mm 6m length PVC sewer pipes cost €137 ex VAT each.
