30 metres next to ditch. Rises 1.2m from 4% slope. That's five six metre pipes.
1 metre at 45 degree angle.
13.75 metres from ditch to house. Rises 0.4m from 3% slope. That's two six metre pipes plus two one metre pipes OR three six metre pipes with four metres spare OR two six metre pipes plus one three metre pipe with one metre spare.
At air inlet, top of pipe would be 0.2m from surface.
Needs to rise by 2.2m to reach inlet. This will take more than two 1m lengths,
as 1m is vertical, 1m is at 45 degrees = 0.707m, leaving 0.5m.
BUT will chop a 0.4m section off the 30 metre length (7m + 0.7m + 30m + 0.7m = 38.4m,
so we are 0.4m too long). So, 0.7m rise from ground, then one
metre pipe = 1.7m, then plus 0.4m = 2.1m.

Stephen's plan (40 metres of pipe):

(This list does not account for spares, which it probably ought to)

1. 6x 170961-002 Pipe DN 200 6m, each comes with a single fit sleeve
2. 4x 170641-002 Pipe DN 200 1m, each comes with a single fit sleeve. Three are for the turns, one is for extra to the condensor.
3. 4x 417021-001 Bend DN 200 45 degree, each comes with a single fit sleeve
4. 1x 417051-001 Double fit sleeve DN 200 to connect unsleeved pipe end to air inlet
5. 1x 170188-003 Air Inlet DN 200 for above ground external air entry
6. 2x 170198-001 Air inlet filter DN 200
7. 1x 227785-003 Condensation collection shaft DN 315/200 for underneath the house
8. 1x 175584-001 Condensation collection shaft cast iron cover for floor of utility room over the shaft
9. 1x 353254-001 GAHE sealing collar DN 315 (up to 4 bar ground water pressure) for where condensation chamber top enters building under floor of utility room
10. 2x 176520-003 Lubricant 250 g


Niall's plan (48 metres of pipe):

1. 7x 170961-002 Pipe DN 200 6m, each comes with a single fit sleeve. Five up top, two on side.
2. 1x 170651-002 Pipe DN 200 3m, each comes with a single fit sleeve. For pipe reaching condensor. Expecting to cut off 1 metre, which would be spare.
3. 3x 170641-002 Pipe DN 200 1m, each comes with a single fit sleeve. Each is for a turn.
4. 4x 417021-001 Bend DN 200 45 degree, each comes with a single fit sleeve
5. 3x 417051-001 Double fit sleeve DN 200, one to connect unsleeved pipe end to air inlet; one to extend air inlet pipe with 0.4 metre length spare; one for use with 1.0 metre spare.
6. 1x 170188-003 Air Inlet DN 200 for above ground external air entry
7. 2x 170198-001 Air inlet filter DN 200
8. 1x 227785-003 Condensation collection shaft DN 315/200 for underneath the house
9. 1x 175584-001 Condensation collection shaft cast iron cover for floor of utility room over the shaft
10. 1x 353254-001 GAHE sealing collar DN 315 (up to 4 bar ground water pressure) for where condensation chamber top enters building under floor of utility room
11. 2x 176520-003 Lubricant 250 g

Biggest Hertz van rental: 3.7m long, 1.75m wide, 1.8m high. This would fit eight pipes across, nine pipes high, which is 72 three metre length pipes.
    - €215 to rent for five days. First 1,590 km is free, after 19c/km ex VAT. It is 2,900 km round trip. So cost is €521.
    - €500 for ferry with van Rosslare to Cherbourg.
    - At 10 litres/100km, would use 290 litres diesel. At €1.70 per litre, €500.
    - Hotels and food still needed.
