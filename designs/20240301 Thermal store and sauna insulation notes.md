## U-values

- 0.639 30mm thick  30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.616 45mm thick  15mm plasterboard + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.592 50mm thick  mineral wool
- 0.341 75mm thick  15mm plasterboard + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.283 68mm thick  37.5mm Kingspan K118 insulated plasterboard  + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.238 80mm thick  50mm Kingspan K108 phenolic board + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.186 103mm thick 72.5mm Kingspam K118 insulated plasterboard  + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu
- 0.181 105mm thick 75mm Kingspan K108 phenolic board + 30mm Kingspan Sauna Satu

Apparently Kingspan phenolic board is happy with continuous 120 C, and they originally make it by baking it at over 200 C. I'm not entirely sure why they use PIR for saunas not phenolic, as supposedly phenolic is moisture safe as well.

Thermal store is 1.7 x 1.7 x 2.91 = 19.8 m2 sides + 5.8 m2 top bottom = 25.5 m2 all surfaces.

BUT one side is exterior wall at 0.15 u-value, so 5 m2 get 0.11 u-value, 20.5 m2 gets rest. So 20% gets 0.15 u-value, 80% gets rest.

If inside is 85 C and outside is 20 C then 65 K difference => 1332.5 m2K for interior, 325 m2K for exterior.

If inside is 55 C and outside is 20 C then 35 K difference => 717.5 m2K for interior, 175 m2K for exterior.

In reality, bottom will not be as warm at top, so leakage will be better than these:

### Winter:

- 0.639 u-value => 851 + 36 = 887 watts leakage worst case
- 0.283 u-value => 377 + 36 = 413 watts leakage worst case
- 0.181 u-value => 241 + 36 = 277 watts leakage worst case

### Summer:

- 0.639 u-value => 458 + 19 = 477 watts leakage worst case
- 0.283 u-value => 203 + 19 = 222 watts leakage worst case
- 0.181 u-value => 130 + 19 = 149 watts leakage worst case


I know from https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13724924.pdf that for a 1.7 m tall tank insulated with 50mm of mineral wool, heat stratification will result in a max 14 C temp difference. If there is any churn at all, more like 11 C. That is approximately 13-14 cm per degree of temp difference.

For a 2.8m tall tank, the temp difference could be 20 - 22 C, for 50 mm of mineral wool. 50 mm of mineral wool has 0.592 u-value.

Let's assume better insulation has a linear effect on stratification. Temp delta to outside would
be average of top and bottom temps, so if there is a 21 C top-bottom difference, a 65 K delta
becomes 65 - (21 / 2) = 54.5.

### Winter:

- 0.639 u-value =>  21 C temp diff => 83.8% = 743 watts after stratification
- 0.283 u-value =>  10 C temp diff => 92.3% = 381 watts after stratification
- 0.181 u-value => 6.4 C temp diff => 95% = 263 watts after stratification

### Summer:

As only top quarter heated, assume tank is one third normal height and thus loses one
third of worst case.

- 0.639 u-value => 159 watts
- 0.283 u-value => 74 watts
- 0.181 u-value => 50 watts



## Wood

Alder and Aspen are the only two woods one should use in a sauna. Not cedar.

Spruce is cheaper, but can emit resin which will burn you and is sticky.
