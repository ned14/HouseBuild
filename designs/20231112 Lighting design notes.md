Main living space is approx 60 m2 (12m x 5m)

Lighting in living space when on full is approx 11k (flood) + 22k (flood) + 11k (downlights) + 4k (LED strip) = 48k lumen.

This results in a maximum lux of around 800, which is quite high :)

However because we are also lighting the walls and ceilings one might in fact only get around 400 lux.


Task intensive (e.g. food prep, work office) should be around 500 lux.

Libraries should be 400 lux.

Gyms and bedrooms are typically 250 lux.

Corridors are 75 lux.
