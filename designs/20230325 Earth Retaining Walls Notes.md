Worst case weight loading is:

     - Blocks are 1.4m long 0.68 wide 0.7 tall. Exactly 0.6666667 m<sup>3</sup>.
     - 7.5 blocks long three blocks high = 10.5m x 0.68 = 7.14 m<sup>2</sup> of area
     - 7.5 blocks long three blocks high = 31,500 kg

Therefore worst case weight loading is 4,412 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.

Safe bearing capacity of soils:

    - Medium clay: 25,000 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - Packed fine sand: 15,000 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - Loose fine sand: 10,000 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - Soft clay: 10,000 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - Very soft clay: 5,000 kg per m<sup>2</sup>.

Should be no problem there.

Normal solid concrete blocks have a density of 2,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.
These have 2,100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

Therefore footing probably ought to be at least 150 mm deep and 1.0m wide.
