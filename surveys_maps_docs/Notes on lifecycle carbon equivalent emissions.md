## Goal

- RIBA 2030 climate challenge of < 625 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>
and < 35 kWh of operational energy per m<sup>2</sup> per year.
    - House has 312 m<sup>2</sup>, so this is 195 metric tonnes of embodied
    carbon and 10,920 kWh of operational energy per year.

## Assumptions

- Irish/UK housing (for a sample 200 m<sup>2</sup> house probably meeting
pre-2019 regs as house was in the UK) has a total lifecycle of:
    - A1-A3 Materials:
        - Masonry: 304 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 179.9 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - A4 Transportation:
        - Masonry: 4.3 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 1.7 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - A5 Construction:
        - Masonry: 39.2 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 37.7 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - B1-B5 Maintenance and Replacement:
        - Masonry: 18.4 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 13.2 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - B6 Energy:
        - Masonry: 376.5 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 386.6 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - B7 Water:
        - Masonry: 11.9 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 11.1 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - C1-C4 End of life:
        - Masonry: 26.9 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
        - Timber Frame: 23.8 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.

- Lithium batteries a total lifecycle of 150-200 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh of capacity
 (source: https://www.energimyndigheten.se/globalassets/forskning--innovation/transporter/c243-the-life-cycle-energy-consumption-and-co2-emissions-from-lithium-ion-batteries-.pdf). This probably assumed a ten year lifespan.
    - Perhaps 73 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh of capacity to manufacture.
    - Note BYD Battery Box are cobalt free, and Lithium Ion Phosphate chemistry.
    - Ours is a 10.24 kWh system weighing 167 kg.
    - It has 96% efficiency.
    - BYD guarantee at least 60% of capacity will remain after ten years OR
    30.82 MWh of power has been supplied by a 10.24 kWh system (this is 3,010
    cycles).

- A Huawei 6kW hybrid inverter had a total lifecycle CO<sub>2e</sub> of 1504 kg,
 23% of which was production, 76% was use (through energy wasted by heat over its
 25 year assumed lifespan), and a fairly unbelievably low < 1% went on end of life

    - Our Sungrow unit is 10kW which would cost a bit more materials in production,
    but the batteries means only very rarely does its waste heat come from the grid.

- A 6kW heat pump has a total lifecycle of 220-260 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kW of
capacity. A 40kW heat pump has a total lifecycle of around 130 kg CO<sub>2e</sub>
per kW of capacity. Lifespan was assumed to be fifteen years. Source: https://www.cibsejournal.com/technical/embodied-energy-the-whole-picture/

- In 2022 the Irish electrical grid emitted 0.389 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh
generated. This is not delivered however, apparently the Irish electrical grid
had transmission losses of 8% in 2022. This gives 0.42 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub> per
kWh delivered.
