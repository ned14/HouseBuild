## Goal

- RIBA 2030 climate challenge of < 625 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>
and < 35 kWh of operational energy per m<sup>2</sup> per year.
    - House has 312 m<sup>2</sup>, so this is 195 metric tonnes of embodied
    carbon and 10,920 kWh of operational energy per year.
    - RIBA uses a 60 year lifespan (the EU uses a 50 year lifespan).
- RIAI's target is < 450 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.
    - This is 140.4 metric tonnes for my house.

## Estimates for my house

Note https://epdireland.lca-data.com/processList.xhtml?stock=PUBLIC lists EPDs
publicly available for building components in Ireland. I note nothing there
on timber frames nor prefabricated floors.

https://www.igbc.ie/generic-data/ supplies estimates for some of the missing
common items.

- Timber seems to be -616 to -681 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub>
per m<sup>3</sup>. God knows how many metres cubed of timber a timber framed
house might use, I assume it isn't a huge amount per m<sup>2</sup>. 
- CEM I (portland cement) is 763 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per metric tonne.
- CEM III (used in readymix) is 371-512 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per metric tonne.
- Solid concrete blocks appear to be 10.6 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub>
per m<sup>2</sup>. A m<sup>2</sup> of concrete block weighs 142.5 kg, therefore
that is 74.4 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per metric tonne..

### Installation

- 114.2 metric tonnes for shell and foundations (366 kg CO<sub>2e</sub>
per m<sup>2</sup>, a non-PH NZEB house might be 267 kg CO<sub>2e</sub>
per m<sup>2</sup>, perhaps the +37% is a bit much, equally triple glazed
windows plus thicker insulation embodies lots more carbon).
- 2 metric tonnes for the lithium batteries.
- 2.5 metric tonnes for the hybrid inverter.
- 12.2 metric tonnes for the solar panels.
- ? for the thermal store.
- ? for heavy lorry transport of all the above.

Already above is 130.9 metric tonnes, this is close to the 140.4 limit.

Avoided:

- 1.5 metric tonnes by avoiding heat pump.

### During use

- 10 metric tonnes as lithium batteries would need replacing five times in sixty years.
- 5 metric tonnes as the hybrid inverter would need replacing two times in sixty years.
- 24.4 metric tonnes as the solar panels would need replacing twice in sixty years.
- ? metric tonnes as the windows would need replacing once in sixty years.

Avoided:

- Any refrigerant leakage from heat pumps or replacement thereof.

This definitely exceeds the RIAI challenge of < 450 kg of embodied
CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> as 170.3 metric tonnes is already
consumed (this is 545 kg of embodied CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>).

#### Operational carbon

- Annual operational energy use per year: 9360 kWh (30 kWh per m<sup>2</sup> per year)
    - Annual grid contribution: 2572 kWh
    - Annual grid demand: 2299 kWh

After offsetting winter by summer, mildly reduces overall CO<sub>2e</sub>
emitted by 106.2 kg per year. This is 6.4 metric tonnes over sixty years.

During winter, it is generally windier, plus we recharge the thermal
store and lithium batteries using cheap night rate electricity which
tends to mostly come from wind farms by definition, so we might in
practice do better than that amount of carbon saved.

- Lithium batteries a total lifecycle of 150-200 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh of capacity
 (source: https://www.energimyndigheten.se/globalassets/forskning--innovation/transporter/c243-the-life-cycle-energy-consumption-and-co2-emissions-from-lithium-ion-batteries-.pdf). This probably assumed a ten year lifespan.
    - Perhaps 73 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh of capacity to manufacture.
    - Note BYD Battery Box are cobalt free, and Lithium Ion Phosphate chemistry.
    - Ours is a 10.24 kWh system weighing 167 kg.
    - It has 96% efficiency.
    - BYD guarantee at least 60% of capacity will remain after ten years OR
    30.82 MWh of power has been supplied by a 10.24 kWh system (this is 3,010
    cycles).

- A Huawei 6kW hybrid inverter had a total lifecycle CO<sub>2e</sub> of 1504 kg,
 23% of which was production, 76% was use (through energy wasted by heat over its
 25 year assumed lifespan), and a fairly unbelievably low < 1% went on end of life
 (source: https://www.ske-solar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zertifikat-Product-Carbon-Footprint-Report-f%C3%BCr-Huawei-SUN2000-6KTL-L1-Wechselrichter.pdf).
    - Our Sungrow unit is 10kW which would cost a bit more materials in production,
    but the batteries means only very rarely does its waste heat come from the grid.

- Solar panels have a total lifecycle CO<sub>2e</sub> of 615 kg per kW. Another
source says 242 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per m<sup>2</sup>.

- A 6kW heat pump has a total lifecycle of 220-260 kg CO<sub>2e</sub> per kW of
capacity. A 40kW heat pump has a total lifecycle of around 130 kg CO<sub>2e</sub>
per kW of capacity. Lifespan was assumed to be fifteen years. Source: https://www.cibsejournal.com/technical/embodied-energy-the-whole-picture/

- In 2022 the Irish electrical grid emitted 0.389 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub> per kWh
generated. This is not delivered however, apparently the Irish electrical grid
had transmission losses of 8% in 2022. This gives 0.42 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub> per
kWh delivered.
