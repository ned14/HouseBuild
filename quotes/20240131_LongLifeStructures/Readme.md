- Groundworks (except clearance, hardcore compacted and level by client)
- Floors: 0.10; Walls: 0.134; Roof (sloped): 0.15; Roof (flat): 0.09. Floor is typical KORE insulated slab, 0.10.

# Excludes:

If I wanted to add sheep's wool to the inner cavity of the sloped roof to reduce its u-value to 0.13, it might cost:

- Sloped roof area: 9.5 + 11.0 + 21.7 + 21.7 + 54.0 + 43.6 = 161.5 m2
- Assuming 400 centres, reduce by 12% = 144 m2 of insulation needed
- https://www.ecologicalbuildingsystems.com/product/cosywool#product-overview says €7.55 ex VAT per m2, 22 kg/m3, R = 0.039
- So approx +€1,250 inc VAT to add sheep's wool for sloped roof

- Fireproof, denser alternatives:
    - €8.85-€10.24 inc VAT per m2, 35 kg/m3 50 mm https://www.goodwins.ie/products/rockwool-sound-slab-50mm-1-2x400mm-5-76m2-1252120.html. €1,274 inc VAT, almost the same but 59% denser and fireproof. R I think might be 0.035?



For internal wall insulation, which needs more density than anything else:

- €20.23 inc VAT per m2, 37 kg/m3 100 mm https://www.ecologicalbuildingsystems.com/product/thermo-hemp-combi-jute
- €16.82-€19.44 inc VAT per m2, 35 kg/m3 100 mm https://www.goodwins.ie/products/rockwool-sound-slab-100mm-1-2x400mm-2-88m2-1252127.html
- €16.57-€18.75 inc VAT per m2, 35 kg/m3 100 mm https://www.goodwins.ie/products/rockwool-sound-slab-100mm-1-2x600mm-4-32m2-1252128.html
- €15.27 inc VAT per m2, 22 kg/m3 100 mm Rockwool Rollbatt
- €16.84 inc VAT per m2, 12 kg/m3 100 mm Isover Acoustic roll

- Rockwool Flexi (predecessor to Sound Slab) is £14.58 inc VAT per m2 in England, which seems similar to Irish prices.
- Rockwool RWA45 is €23.60 per m2 in Ireland, yet only £8.58 inc VAT in England. It is 45 kg/m3. https://buildersinsulation.co.uk/products/100mm---rockwool-rwa45-acoustic-sound-insulation-slab---2.88m2-pack.html
- Rockwool RW3 is £13.54 inc VAT in England. It is 60 kg/m3.

Just to make a person really wince:

- £27.43 https://www.muffle.co.uk/rockwool-rwa45-acoustic-slab-insulation-100mm-2-88m2-pack-of-4.html
- €68.25 https://ie.muffleacoustics.com/rockwool-rwa45-acoustic-slab-insulation-100mm-2-88m2-pack-of-4.html


# Payment terms:

- €25k incl VAT deposit.
- €83k for the foundations completed (minus pool).
- 40%: Prepayment of offsite manufacture (€92k)
- 40%: Prepayment of install (€92k)
- Balance: Engineering sign for frame (€45k)
- €56k for the airtightness.

€230k needs to go out in near future.

# Other notes:
- The split stud EcoTech Homes quote was for €472,108 inc VAT to first fix. Differences to this quote:

    - Walls: 0.13; Roof (sloped): 0.16; Roof (flat): 0.11

    - Includes roof slates and flat roof EPDM (29k)
    - Includes more of the groundworks (maybe worth 18k)
    - Includes all plasterboard (maybe €53k though that includes labour)
    - Includes installing roof windows
    - Includes insulation for internal walls (5k?).

    Taking those off, that quote would reduce to €367k, literally the same as the split stud EcoTech quote on a like for like basis.

- The single stud EcoTech Homes quote was for €361,297 inc VAT to first fix. Differences to this quote:

    - Walls: 0.16; Roof (sloped): 0.16; Roof (flat): 0.11.

    - Includes roof slates and flat roof EPDM (29k)
    - Includes more of the groundworks (maybe worth 18k)
    - Includes all plasterboard (maybe €53k though that includes labour)
    - Includes installing roof windows
    - Includes insulation for internal walls (5k?).

    Taking those off, that quote would reduce to €256k. So the above quote is 111k more than the single stud EcoTech quote on a like for like basis.

- Closest competing quote for a similar spec is TimberFrameIreland. This is from last year for a 300 mm split stud:

    Main house: €218,328 inc VAT to first fix (€92,620 + €38,030 "The Eco Package" which is the 300 mm split stud + €2,690 + €6,740 + €860 + €51,420). This is €732 inc VAT per sqm.

    - Excludes air tightness taping (14k probably)
    - Excludes air blower test
    - **Question:** Is roof truss and flat roof insulation included by TimberFrameIreland? If not, potentially 20k there.

    - Walls have 0.11 u-value instead of 0.13. Roof (sloped) has 0.11 u-value instead of 0.13.

    Assuming same cost of air tightness and insulation minus walls (so maybe +35k), that would be 253k inc VAT. The above quote is 71.9% more money for 18% worse u-values.
