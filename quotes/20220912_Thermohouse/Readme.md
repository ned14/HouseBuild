# Other notes:

- If combined with outer block leaf, they claim it falls under 'standard construction' and I suppose given it's then similar to insulated block on flat it probably does tick that box.
- To reach passive air tightness with ICF one generally must spray all the inside of the building enveloper with a rubberised layer to seal all the tiny gaps. As with any new building, foundations will shift over time and tears can appear in that rubberised layer, requiring a second spray a decade in or so.
- Obviously all that concrete, polystyrene and steel is absolutely hideous for the embodied CO2, though not much between this and the average NZEB spec Irish new build to be honest.
