# Other notes:

- Nicely compatible with the stage drawdown payments Irish banks use.
- Cheaper than the QS builder's finish estimate (€633k), but does less stuff -- I reckon €20k of stuff from the QS estimate is obviously removed. I would wonder if the quote might rise slightly when he sees construction detail, as the quote did not seem overly detail focused.
- Looks weirdly similar in technology and spec to the Eco 220 system from https://www.llstructures.ie/wall-systems/
who are a Galway based timber frame builder also using cellulose insulation.
So much so in fact so I've downloaded the ACDs from there into here, as
I reckon them almost identical.
- The only other 220 mm thick cellulose filled panel I can find in Ireland
is Carrigaline's Eco Timber Systems https://ecotimbersystems.ie/timber-systems/wall-systems/220-passive/.
Note that it is within PHPP, which will save time.
