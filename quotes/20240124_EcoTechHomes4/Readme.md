# Other notes:
- This differs from the earlier quote as it is for a 300 mm split stud with posi-joists, rather than 220 mm with normal joists. The price for the earlier spec was €361,297 inc VAT. This, obviously enough, is €110,811 more.
- Closest competing quote is TimberFrameIreland. This is from last year, but for the same 300 mm split stud:

    Main house: €218,328 inc VAT to first fix (€92,620 + €38,030 "The Eco Package" which is the 300 mm split stud + €2,690 + €6,740 + €860 + €51,420). This is €732 inc VAT per sqm.

    - Excludes roof slates and flat roof EPDM (29k)
    - Excludes more of the groundworks (maybe worth 18k)
    - Excludes internal wall insulation
    - Excludes all plasterboard (maybe €53k though that includes labour)
    - Excludes scaffolding hire
    - Excludes installing roof windows
    - Excludes air blower test
    - **Question:** Is roof truss and flat roof insulation included?

    - Walls have 0.11 u-value instead of 0.13. Roof (sloped) has 0.11 u-value (includes plasterboard) instead of 0.16 (excludes plasterboard).
