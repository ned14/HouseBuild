NOTE that this quote is for the 006730, NOT the 008230. These have a u-value of 0.83 W/m2K. An additional double glazed panel would need to be fitted to each to turn them into the 008230.

This quote: €21,613 inc VAT.

The Fakro quote: €21,532 inc VAT.

So even at triple not quintuple glazed, the Fakros are cheaper.

The Fakros can't self open, they are only manual, so it isn't a like for like comparison.

Also the Fakros don't have as good u-values, 0.70 W/m2K vs 0.57 W/m2K.
