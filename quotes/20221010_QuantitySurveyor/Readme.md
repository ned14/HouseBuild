# Includes:

- Walls: 0.15 (with external block leaf); Roof: 0.14.
- Structural Engineering and system design work
- Air tightness test. I don't know how this works when they don't fit the windows and doors. It will meet NZEB, unsure if it would meet PH spec (I would assume it will).

# Excludes:

- Groundworks
- Foundations (+47k cost)
- External windows and doors (+69k cost)
- Wiring (+10k cost)
- Plumbing (+4k cost)
- External block leaf (plastered) (+53k cost assuming 333 m2 of exterior wall at €160 per sqm plastered)
- External footpaths (+26k cost)
- Roof slates (+25k cost)
- Glass Ballustarding (+16k cost)
- Stairs (+5k cost)
- Internal doors (+12k cost including skirting and window sills)
- Rubbish removal
- Site costs such as scaffolding, welfare cabin for workers, waste disposal etc.

# Payment terms:

Unsure

# Other notes:

- Very similarly priced to the FutureTek quote. As in, within a few grand.
- Comes to €447k inc VAT to Builder's Finish, which looks cheap compared to the EcoTech quote of €636k. However this would be all direct labour, with all the attendent risk and hassle and time delays and stress on me.
