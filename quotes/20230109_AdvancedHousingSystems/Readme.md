# Other notes:

- The cash flow crunch is going to be particularly problematic here, because the bank's mortgage drawdown stages don't map onto their stages. I reckon I would need to front about half the total build cost which would need to be completed before the bank would let me drawdown. That is a problem.
- Once accounting for structural and M&E engineering, this is a touch (13k!) cheaper than the Ecotech quote.
    - I filled in the items which the Ecotech quote includes, but we'd need to supply with this contractor, from the Quantity surveyor's estimates. It thinks those items would sum to €151k. On that basis, this quote ought to be €795k.
- The spec of this house is way higher than the Ecotech quote. Vastly superior u-values for one, I suspect build quality would be better too, so the +21% cost is likely competitive for the spec delivered. However €138k is an awful lot of money which can be used to buy other stuff instead.
