# Other notes:

- Very similarly priced to the Cygnum quote. As in, within a few grand.
- Comes to €451k inc VAT to Builder's Finish, which looks cheap compared to the EcoTech quote of €636k. However this would be all direct labour, with all the attendent risk and hassle and time delays and stress on me.
